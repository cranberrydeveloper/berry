      Berry Wiki is a women’s health wiki with information in the form of audio, video, and text designed for the women of today. 

At Cranberry, we believe there is a big gap between what women seek and the information available online. More importantly, we see that the information available online needs to be contextualized to India. We have a team of researchers who create and contextualize information to train our chatbot, Berry. We intend to make this information open source. 

Berry Wiki will provide women’s health, specifically preventive health-related information in a simple, easy-to-understand, intuitive-to-navigate way. 

The scope of the project is ONLY UX and not the tech backend. We currently use wix.com for hosting our side, happy to use another provider. One of the sites that comes closest to our vision is https://helloclue.com/articles
But we believe it is not designed for how a user might want to navigate information especially when they are seeking answers for a specific question like “Is my period late?”, “Do I have heavy bleeding?”

      Description: 
        1. How do women consume health content?
          a. Medium?
          b. Depth of science required
          c. Format of information consumption
        2. What’s the best way to communicate health content?
          a. Navigation and layout on a web-page
          b. How to interconnect audio, video, text content?
          c. How to make easy to navigate through questions
          d. How to make it easy to engage with the content

      description: Women’s Health content often feels confusing and backed by anecdotes than science.
Growing up, we were told to bear the pain or follow “nuskas” or random remedies. “Don't take painkillers for periods” “Eat x for y.” No reason was given for why we felt something. No explanation of how or why it will help.
Today, it is impossible to judge what the truth is among the clutter of information. Differentiate the facts from the noise. “It is your hormones” “Pamper your PMS with some cake” “Seed Cycling will balance it all”
How are we changing this?
By bringing only data-backed science in a transparent way to you.
Let’s start now! Here’s what we mean by “data-backed science”
Science for which the evidence comes from published clinical trials or data studies. E.g. “5 Trials show ginger helps with period pain” or “Multiple studies inconclusive on hormones impact on workouts”
Women’s health has fewer clinical trials. So we also factor in science that comes from published papers that study the why and how in a lab setting. E.g. “The cause of PMS is not the level of hormones, but the individual sensitivity”
What do we mean by “in a transparent way”?
Video content that is easy and fun. But hey, it is 5-15 minutes long. As we want to demystify women’s health. And we know so do you.
We always share the limitations of the current scientific understanding. E.g. “Women’s health has fewer clinical trials” or “The cause of PMS is unknown” (crazy but true!)
We always share our sources.

      description: 
              Goal 1 - To become a go to source for evidence backed women’s health information, in Indian context
              Goal 2 - To be part of our community – 
              All content is based on data-backed science. And delivered by Coaches, Nutritionists, Gynaecologists, and Health Scientists who are women like you wanting answers. Sometimes, men too :).
              What do we mean by Women's Health?
              Much more than fertility! Things we deal with continuously - Periods, PMS mood & energy changes, Hormonal Migraines, Vaginal stuff, Breast Tenderness. And then some things that happen to women much more than men – Pain during sex, Bloating, Lower back Pain, Knee Pain, Sleep Disturbances.
